MindBending Productions is hosted in a multi-availability zone, multi-region architecture within Amazon Web Services (AWS).  This architecture allows for a very quick Recover Time Objective (RTO) and a short Recover Point Objective (RPO).

The RTO in the event of a single availability zone (AZ) is negligible.  Since the database is in a multi-availability zone configuration, if one availability zone goes down the database in the other availability zone will automatically pick up and store user information.  If a user is actively on the website at the time of disruption they may see a slight blip in service, but likely a quick retry of the command will work properly.

In the event of a single region outage within AWS, the RTO might be a bit longer as the read replica in the secondary region is a read replica and the data is only in read-only mode.  At this point, no new data can be stored until either the primary region comes back online or we promote the read replica to a read-write mode.  This will be dependent on management's decision which will likely be based on the AWS outage.  The reliability of the Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) in a Multi-AZ Data Plane is currently listed at 99.990% (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/appendix-a-designed-for-availability-for-select-aws-services.html)

The RPO for a single availability zone or single region outage is less than 1 hour.  In the event of a failure of a single AZ, the secondary AZ will quickly come online in order to provide continuity of service.  In the event of a failure of a single region (primary) the data will be stored in a read-only mode in the read replica in the secondary region.  If the failure is in the secondary region, then the read replica will offline until the region comes back online.
